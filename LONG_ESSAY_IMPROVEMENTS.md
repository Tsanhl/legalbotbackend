# Long Essay Recommendation System - Updated

## ✅ Successfully Implemented

### Overview
The long essay recommendation system now intelligently distinguishes between two scenarios and provides appropriate recommendations for each:

---

## 📊 Two Versions Implemented

### **Version 1: New Essay Generation**
**When**: User asks AI to generate a blank essay from scratch

**Detection**: No indicators of user's own draft in the message

**Example Messages**:
- "Write a 12000 word essay on contract law"
- "Generate a 6000 word essay on tort law"
- "Create an 8000 word dissertation on criminal justice"

**Recommendation Message**:
```
📝 Long Essay Detected (12,000 words)

For best results with essays over 5,000 words, I recommend breaking this into 4 parts:

Suggested Approach:
1. Ask for Part 1 (~3,000 words) - Introduction + first 3 sections
2. Then ask "Continue with Part 2" for the next sections
3. Then ask 'Continue with Part 3' for the remaining sections
4. Finally ask 'Continue with Part 4 - Conclusion'

Why break into parts?
- The AI has memory and will continue coherently
- Each part will hit its word count accurately
- No repetitive content across parts
- Better quality and depth in each section

Or proceed now and I'll write as much as I can (~3,500-4,000 words), 
then you can ask me to "Continue" for the rest.
```

---

### **Version 2: User Draft Improvement**
**When**: User submits their own essay and asks for improvement

**Detection**: Message contains indicators like:
- "here is my essay"
- "improve my essay"
- "please check my"
- "can you review"
- "better version of this"
- And 15+ other patterns

**Example Messages**:
- "Here is my 8000 word essay. Please improve it."
- "Can you check my 6000 word essay and make it better?"
- "Please improve my 10000 word dissertation"

**Recommendation Message**:
```
📝 Long Essay Improvement Detected (8,000 words)

For best results with essays over 5,000 words, I recommend breaking this into 3 parts:

The parts will be according to your essay structure.
Total output will be 8,000 words as you requested.

Why break into parts?
- The AI has memory and will continue coherently
- Each part will hit its word count accurately
- Better quality and depth in each section
- Your essay structure will be preserved

Or proceed now and I'll improve as much as I can (~3,500-4,000 words), 
then you can ask me to "Continue" for the rest.
```

**Key Differences from Version 1**:
- ✅ Simplified structure explanation
- ✅ Emphasizes "parts according to YOUR essay structure"
- ✅ Confirms total output matches user's requested word count
- ✅ Mentions essay structure preservation

---

## Backend-Only Note

The old Streamlit/UI layer has been removed. The long-essay split logic remains in the backend, and callers should pause or resume generation using their own controller code.

## 🛑 Stop Before Automatic Generation

### Problem Solved
Previously, after showing the recommendation, the system would immediately show the "Thinking..." indicator and start generating, which was confusing.

### Solution Implemented
Added `await_user_choice` flag:
```python
result['await_user_choice'] = True  # For all long essays (>= 5000 words)
```

### Behavior Now
1. **Show recommendation** ✅
2. **Show prompt**: "💡 **Please respond** with either:
   - 'Proceed now' - I'll write ~3,500-4,000 words
   - 'Part 1' or your specific request - To start with the parts approach"
3. **STOP** - No "Thinking..." indicator ✅
4. **Wait** for user to make their choice
5. **Only then** proceed with AI generation

### Technical Implementation
In backend caller/controller code:
```python
if long_essay_info["await_user_choice"]:
    return {"status": "await_user_choice", "message": long_essay_info["suggestion_message"]}
```

## 📁 Files Modified

### 1. `gemini_service.py`
**Function**: `detect_long_essay(message: str) -> dict`

**New Fields Added**:
- `'is_user_draft'`: bool - Whether user is submitting their own essay
- `'await_user_choice'`: bool - Whether to wait for user choice before proceeding

**Detection Logic**:
```python
# Detect user draft indicators
user_draft_indicators = [
    'here is my essay', 'here is my draft', 'my essay:', 'my draft:',
    'i wrote this', 'i have written', 'my attempt', 'my version',
    'please check my', 'please review my', 'please improve my',
    'can you check', 'can you review', 'is this correct',
    # ... and more
]

result['is_user_draft'] = any(indicator in msg_lower for indicator in user_draft_indicators)

# VERSION 1 vs VERSION 2
if not result['is_user_draft']:
    # Show detailed breakdown (Introduction + sections)
else:
    # Show simplified structure (according to your essay)
```

### 2. `backend_answer_runtime.py`
**New Logic**:
```python
if long_essay_info['is_long_essay']:
    if long_essay_info['await_user_choice']:
        return {"status": "await_user_choice", "message": long_essay_info["suggestion_message"]}

# Only reached if NOT awaiting user choice
response = generate_answer(...)
```

## 🎯 User Experience Flow

### Scenario 1: User Requests New 12,000 Word Essay

**Step 1**: User enters:
```
"Write a 12000 word essay on contract law"
```

**Step 2**: System shows:
```
📝 Long Essay Detected (12,000 words)

For best results with essays over 5,000 words, I recommend breaking this into 4 parts:

Suggested Approach:
1. Ask for Part 1 (~3,000 words) - Introduction + first 3 sections
2. Then ask "Continue with Part 2" for the next sections
...

💡 Please respond with either:
- "Proceed now" - I'll write ~3,500-4,000 words
- "Part 1" or your specific request - To start with the parts approach
```

**Step 3**: ⚠️ **STOPS HERE** - no backend generation yet

**Step 4**: User responds with choice:
- "Proceed now" → Generates ~3,500-4,000 words
- "Part 1" → Generates Part 1 with ~3,000 words

---

### Scenario 2: User Submits Their 8,000 Word Essay

**Step 1**: User enters:
```
"Here is my 8000 word essay. Please improve it: [essay text]"
```

**Step 2**: System shows:
```
📝 Long Essay Improvement Detected (8,000 words)

For best results with essays over 5,000 words, I recommend breaking this into 3 parts:

The parts will be according to your essay structure.
Total output will be 8,000 words as you requested.
...

💡 Please respond with either:
- "Proceed now" - I'll improve ~3,500-4,000 words
- "Part 1" or your specific request - To start with the parts approach
```

**Step 3**: ⚠️ **STOPS HERE** - No "Thinking..." yet

**Step 4**: User responds with choice

---

## 💡 Benefits

### 1. **Clarity**
- Version 1 vs Version 2 messages are clear and appropriate
- Users understand what to expect

### 2. **Control**
- Users choose their approach before AI starts generating
- No more confusion about whether to continue or restart

### 3. **Flexibility**
- Works for both new essays and improvements
- Adapts message to scenario

### 4. **Better UX**
- No "Thinking..." indicator appearing prematurely
- Clear prompts guide user to next step

---

## 🔍 Detection Accuracy

### Version 1 Triggers (New Essay):
- "Write a X word essay"
- "Generate an essay"
- "Create a dissertation"
- Any request WITHOUT user draft indicators

### Version 2 Triggers (User Draft):
- "Here is my essay"
- "Improve my essay"
- "Check my essay"
- "Review my draft"
- "Better version of this"
- 15+ other patterns

### Edge Cases Handled:
✅ "Write my 12000 word essay" → Version 1 (possessive "my" with "write")
✅ "Improve my 8000 word essay" → Version 2 ("improve my")
✅ "Here is my 6000 word essay, make it better" → Version 2 ("here is my")

## ⚖️ Clarifications to Apply Going Forward

### 1) Source Selection Order (Index First, Then Web)

For legal essay/problem answers, use this order:

1. Search and use relevant materials already in indexed/internal documents first.
2. If the indexed materials are insufficient, use web search as a fallback.
3. When using web fallback, prioritize and ground citations in these domains first:
   - `legislation.gov.uk`
   - `caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk`
   - `supremecourt.uk`
   - `judiciary.uk`
   - `bailii.org` (if accessible)
   - `lawcom.gov.uk` / `gov.uk` (Law Commission and official policy materials)

### 2) Jurisdiction Policy (Primary Default, Not Hard Lock)

- Primary default jurisdiction: England and Wales.
- Do not hard-lock all questions to England and Wales.
- Determine the final jurisdiction from the user’s actual question:
  - If user asks for USA/another jurisdiction, answer in that jurisdiction.
  - If mixed or comparative, state scope clearly and separate authorities by jurisdiction.

### 3) Topic-Specific Guideline Placement and Part Renumbering

- Add topic-specific guideline sections before the general essay/problem methodology section.
- If the relevant topic section already exists, update that existing section first instead of creating duplicate guidance.
- If no relevant topic section exists, create a new topic-specific part in that location.
- If a new section is inserted at `Part X`, renumber all subsequent parts sequentially.
- Example: inserting a new `Part 15` means current `Part 16` becomes `Part 17`, and so on.
- Keep references/cross-links synchronized after renumbering.

### 4) Word Allocation When User Gives Only Total Word Count

- If user provides only a total word count (not per-question/per-part), the system must auto-allocate words across outputs.
- Multi-part planning cap: `max 2,000 words per part`.
- Default allocation method:
  - derive minimum parts from the cap: `parts = ceil(total_words / 2000)`.
  - use cap-first planning then remainder in the final part.
  - examples:
    - `3,500 -> 2,000 + 1,500`
    - `5,500 -> 2,000 + 2,000 + 1,500`
- For multi-topic legal sets, use per-part targets and show them explicitly in planning output.
- Do not require user to provide per-question word counts unless they ask for custom allocation.
- Keep each part within operational limits and rebalance remaining parts dynamically if a previous part over/under-runs.

---

## 🧪 Output Quality and Legal Accuracy Controls

### A) Quality Baseline and Trust Threshold

- Baseline interpretation for the sample output: `6/10`.
- Meaning of `6/10`: structure and flow are usable, but legal authority hygiene and doctrinal precision are not yet reliable.
- Trust threshold before delivery: no unresolved citation integrity issue and no unflagged cross-jurisdiction contamination.

### B) Priority Defects to Detect and Fix First

1. Citation integrity / hallucination risk
   - Re-verify every cited case name and neutral citation before final output.
   - If citation cannot be verified, remove it or mark it as uncertain and replace with a verified authority.
   - Example correction pattern:
     - Avoid unverified `Williams v Williams [2024] EWFC 12`.
     - Use verified `Williams v Williams [2024] EWFC 275` (if that is the intended authority).

2. Jurisdiction contamination
   - Remove Scottish or non-relevant jurisdiction authorities in an England and Wales divorce-finance answer unless the question asks comparative analysis.
   - Remove non-divorce/non-family noise (for example inheritance/death authorities) unless directly relevant to the legal issue asked.

3. Overstated doctrine
   - Avoid absolute claims like “dismantled,” “dead,” or “governing presumption” unless directly supported by binding authority in those terms.
   - Safer formulation standard:
     - “Narrow/rare in practice” instead of “extinct.”
     - “Strong statutory steer toward clean break” instead of “automatic presumption.”

4. Problem-question fact drift
   - Anchor every disputed issue to the exact facts in the question.
   - If facts state a bonus is post-separation, treat post-separation characterization as the starting point and only discuss alternatives as conditional branches.

5. Invented or assumed facts
   - Do not introduce pension or valuation assumptions unless present in facts.
   - If assumptions are necessary for analysis, label them explicitly as assumptions and show how outcomes vary.

### C) Answer Adequacy Standard (Essay and Problem)

- Essay answers must be:
  - follow this strict reasoning template: `thesis -> competing arguments -> doctrinal limits -> balanced conclusion`;
  - be critical, balanced, and not one-directional;
  - be explicit on doctrinal limits and counter-arguments;
  - be precise on the current legal position versus historical development.
- Problem answers must be:
  - follow this strict reasoning template: `issue -> rule -> application to facts -> likely outcome range`;
  - be evidence-led under the relevant statutory gateway for that topic;
  - be fact-anchored with assumption labels where needed;
  - avoid single over-confident endpoint conclusions.
- Fact anchoring is mandatory:
  - each major conclusion must cite at least one concrete case fact from the question.
- Confidence calibration is mandatory:
  - avoid absolute conclusions unless clearly required by binding authority;
  - use calibrated phrasing such as `likely`, `strong argument`, `tribunal-dependent`.

### D) Retrieval and Chunking Defaults (Quality Over Volume)

- Prefer fewer, cleaner authorities over high-volume mixed retrieval.
- Recommended defaults:
  - `max_docs`: `8-12`
  - `top_chunks_before_rerank`: `20-30`
  - `final_chunks_injected`: `8-12`
  - `chunk_size_tokens`: `700-1000`
  - `chunk_overlap_tokens`: `80-150`
- Retrieval precision gate (mandatory):
  - apply a hard pre-filter layer before final retrieval:
    - `topic`: must match the asked topic (for example, employment status / gig economy / unfair dismissal)
    - `jurisdiction`: England and Wales by default unless user specifies another
    - `source_type`: statute | judgment | core textbook
  - if top retrieved documents fail this filter profile, automatically re-query until the profile is satisfied.
- Multi-part retrieval isolation (mandatory):
  - lock retrieval scope to the active part/topic only (for example, Part 4 must not reuse Part 1 topic filters).
  - reset part-level retrieval state between parts to prevent cross-topic contamination.
- Retrieval sufficiency gate (mandatory):
  - define minimum evidence thresholds before drafting:
    - minimum relevant documents retrieved
    - minimum usable context length
  - if below threshold, trigger fallback retrieval flow before writing.
- Source diversity gate (mandatory):
  - minimum mix per final answer:
    - statutes: at least `2`
    - binding/leading cases: at least `4`
    - secondary commentary: at least `1` (textbook or journal)
  - “enough sources” means relevant diversity and quality, not just quantity.

### E) Filtering and Source Priority Rules

- Default legal filter profile (unless question requires otherwise):
  - primary jurisdiction: England and Wales
  - subject: question-specific (for example financial remedies, employment status, unfair dismissal)
  - source-type priority: statute/judgment > textbook > commentary
- Exclude Scotland and non-family authorities unless explicitly requested by user question.
- Domain priority for web fallback:
  1. `legislation.gov.uk`
  2. `caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk`
  3. `supremecourt.uk`
  4. `judiciary.uk`
  5. `bailii.org` (if accessible)
  6. `lawcom.gov.uk` / `gov.uk`
- Down-rank:
  - student note sites
  - uncited general blogs
  - mixed-jurisdiction sources without clear filters
- Topic-focused must-cover authority sets:
  - for Employment Law (worker status + unfair dismissal), the final answer should cover where relevant:
    - `ERA 1996 s230` and `ERA 1996 s94`
    - `WTR 1998` holiday pay provisions
    - `TULRCA 1992` relevant protection provisions
    - core cases: `Ready Mixed Concrete`, `Autoclenz`, `Pimlico`, `Uber`
    - at least one clearly relevant recent authority where applicable
  - for Data Protection Law (ADM, breach, erasure), the final answer should cover where relevant:
    - `UK GDPR` Articles `5`, `6`, `13-15`, `17`, `22`, `33`, `34`, `82`
    - `Data Protection Act 2018` relevant enforcement/remedy framework
    - ICO/EDPB guidance on automated decisions and breach notification
  - for Consumer Law (digital content + services), the final answer should cover where relevant:
    - `CRA 2015` Chapter 3 (`ss33-47`) and Chapter 4 (`ss49`, `54-57`)
    - Part 2 unfair terms (`s62` and Schedule 2 indicators)
    - relevant guidance/case support for digital content remedies and service non-performance

### F) Mandatory Pre-Edit Workflow

Apply this sequence before rewriting content:

1. Lock authority whitelist for the specific question scope.
2. Re-verify each cited authority and neutral citation.
3. Rewrite legal propositions to remove absolute/overbroad claims.
4. Re-run problem analysis strictly from given facts and explicit assumptions.
5. Only then do style and length polishing.
- Citation-integrity gate (blocker):
  - do not finalize output if any cited authority is absent from retrieved evidence or unverified primary source.
  - every legal proposition must map to at least one verified source anchor.
  - no post-generation clean-up message like “removed non-retrieved authority mentions”; that indicates retrieval-generation misalignment and requires re-run before delivery.
- Final legal QA checklist (mandatory pass before output):
  1. Correct jurisdiction and scope.
  2. Core authorities present and verified.
  3. No irrelevant domains/documents used.
  4. No invented facts or unlabelled assumptions.
  5. Clear rights gateway and remedy limits for the claimant status found.
  6. Per-part and cumulative word counts are within strict `99%-100%` windows (no exceeding target).
- RAG error-handling gate (mandatory):
  - never call retrieval with `n_results <= 0`; enforce `n_results = max(1, requested_n)` guard.
  - if index returns no relevant documents, skip broken retrieval output and trigger fallback path:
    1. broaden indexed query with controlled synonyms;
    2. re-run with topic whitelist and source-type constraints;
    3. if still insufficient, perform web fallback using prioritized domains.
  - if fallback still fails, output a structured insufficiency notice and avoid fabricated authorities.

### G) Topic Example Calibration Note

- For the pasted Employment sample, a realistic quality range is `5.5-6.5/10` when retrieval contamination and authority mismatch persist.
- In that state, writing structure may still be strong; evidence control remains the primary bottleneck.
