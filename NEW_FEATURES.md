# New Features Added to Legal AI Essay Assistant

## Overview
Two new intelligent features have been added to enhance the essay writing and improvement capabilities with better source integration and targeted paragraph improvements.

---

## Feature 1: Google Search with OSCOLA Citations

### What it does:
Automatically detects when the knowledge database is insufficient for answering a query and emphasizes the use of Google Search to find additional authoritative sources. All Google Search sources are automatically cited in proper OSCOLA format.

### Key Behaviors:
1. **Automatic Detection**: The system detects when:
   - RAG context is too short (< 500 characters) or empty
   - User asks about recent cases/laws (2025, 2026, recent, latest, current)
   - Complex academic queries (critically discuss, evaluate, assess)
   - Essay writing requests (especially longer essays)
   - Specific legal areas needing current updates (AI law, data protection, etc.)

2. **OSCOLA Citation Enforcement**: 
   - All Google Search sources MUST be cited in OSCOLA format
   - Citations appear in parentheses () immediately after relevant sentences
   - Citations are marked with ** for emphasis: `(Montgomery v Lanarkshire Health Board [2015] UKSC 11).**`
   - System verifies citations before output

3. **Examples of Proper Citations**:
   ```
   "The principle of informed consent has evolved significantly (Montgomery v Lanarkshire Health Board [2015] UKSC 11).**"
   
   "Academic commentary suggests a shift towards patient autonomy (J Herring, 'The Place of Parental Rights in Medical Law' (2014) 42 Journal of Medical Ethics 146).**"
   ```

### Implementation Details:
- Function: `should_use_google_search_grounding(message, rag_context)` in `gemini_service.py`
- Returns: Detection result with reason and OSCOLA enforcement flag
- Integration: Automatically adds contextual instructions to AI prompts when triggered

## Feature 2: Specific Paragraph Improvement Mode

### What it does:
Intelligently distinguishes between requests for specific paragraph improvements vs full essay rewrites, providing targeted feedback and amendments only where needed.

### Three Usage Scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: "Which paragraphs can be improved?"
**User asks**: "which para can be improved" or "tell me which paragraphs need improvement"

**AI Response**:
```
The following paragraphs need improvement:
- Para 1 (Introduction): Lacks clear thesis statement
- Para 3 (Legal Framework): Missing key case law
- Para 5 (Conclusion): Too brief

Here are the amended paragraphs:

Para 1 (Introduction) - AMENDED:
[Full improved paragraph text...]

Para 3 (Legal Framework) - AMENDED:
[Full improved paragraph text...]

Para 5 (Conclusion) - AMENDED:
[Full improved paragraph text...]
```

**Behavior**: 
- Identifies which paragraphs need work
- Provides ONLY the amended versions of those paragraphs
- Does NOT rewrite the entire essay

#### Scenario 2: "Improve my whole essay"
**User asks**: "improve my essay" or "improve the whole essay" or "rewrite essay"

**AI Response**:
- Outputs the ENTIRE essay with all improvements applied
- No paragraph identification - comprehensive rewrite
- Makes improvements throughout the entire text

#### Scenario 3: "Improve specific paragraphs"
**User asks**: "improve para 2 and para 4" or "fix the introduction"

**AI Response**:
```
Para 2 - AMENDED:
[Full improved paragraph...]

Para 4 - AMENDED:
[Full improved paragraph...]
```

**Behavior**:
- Outputs ONLY the requested paragraphs
- Labels each clearly
- Focuses improvement effort on those specific sections

### Implementation Details:
- Function: `detect_specific_para_improvement(message)` in `gemini_service.py`
- Detection patterns include:
  - Paragraph references: "para 1", "paragraph 2", "first para", "last para"
  - Improvement keywords: "which can be improved", "tell me which", "identify which"
  - Whole essay patterns: "improve whole essay", "improve all", "rewrite essay"
- Returns: `improvement_type` ('specific_paras' or 'whole_essay') and `which_paras` (list of mentioned paragraphs)
- Integration: Adds mode-specific instructions to guide AI behavior

---

## Technical Architecture

### Files Modified:
1. **gemini_service.py**:
   - Added `detect_specific_para_improvement()` function (lines 430+)
   - Added `should_use_google_search_grounding()` function (lines 513+)
   - Updated `SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION` with new mode instructions (lines 959-1020)
   - Integrated detection into `send_message_with_docs()` (lines 726-778)

### Detection Flow:
```
User Message
    ↓
detect_specific_para_improvement(message)
    ↓
detect Google Search needs (message, rag_context)
    ↓
Add contextual instructions to AI prompt
    ↓
Send to the selected backend provider with mode-specific guidance
    ↓
AI responds according to detected mode
```

### Console Logging:
Both features log their activity for debugging:
```
[PARA IMPROVEMENT MODE] Specific paragraphs - ['para 1', 'introduction']
[GOOGLE SEARCH] Enabled - Reason: Detected indicator: essay
[GOOGLE SEARCH] OSCOLA citations will be enforced for all external sources
```

## User Experience

### Before:
- Users couldn't get targeted paragraph feedback without full rewrites
- Google Search sources were not consistently cited in OSCOLA format
- No distinction between "show me what needs work" vs "fix everything"

### After:
- Users can ask "which paragraphs can be improved" and get specific, actionable feedback
- All external sources automatically cited in proper OSCOLA format with ** markers
- System intelligently routes to appropriate improvement mode
- Better source integration with academic integrity maintained

## Testing Examples

### Test Case 1: Paragraph Improvement Request
**Input**: "Can you tell me which paragraphs in my essay need improvement?"
**Expected**: System identifies weak paragraphs + provides only those amended versions

### Test Case 2: Whole Essay Improvement
**Input**: "Improve my entire essay"
**Expected**: System rewrites complete essay with improvements throughout

### Test Case 3: Google Search + OSCOLA
**Input**: "Write a 3000 word essay on AI regulation and data protection"
**Expected**: 
- System detects essay + modern topics
- Uses Google Search for recent sources
- All citations in OSCOLA format with ** markers
- Console shows: `[GOOGLE SEARCH] Enabled - Reason: Detected indicator: essay`

### Test Case 4: Specific Paragraph Fix
**Input**: "Improve paragraph 2 and the conclusion"
**Expected**: 
- System outputs only Para 2 and conclusion
- Labels as "Para 2 - AMENDED:" and "Conclusion - AMENDED:"
- Console shows: `[PARA IMPROVEMENT MODE] Specific paragraphs - ['para 2', 'conclusion']`

## Benefits

1. **Academic Integrity**: Ensures all external sources are properly cited in OSCOLA format
2. **Efficiency**: Users get targeted feedback without rewriting entire essays unnecessarily
3. **Flexibility**: System adapts to user needs - specific feedback vs comprehensive improvement
4. **Source Quality**: Encourages use of Google Search when knowledge base is insufficient
5. **User Clarity**: Clear labeling and structure makes it obvious which mode is active

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for later:
- Support for section-level improvements (e.g., "improve all of Part II")
- Citation format validation and suggestion
- Paragraph quality scoring (1-10 scale)
- Side-by-side comparison view (original vs amended)
- Export amended paragraphs separately for easy copy-paste
